# Sending-notifications-based-on-real-time-FPL-data
Fetching live data from official FPL API using login credentials and processing the data to send custom real-time notifications to client devices. Used the Paho client to publish to MQTT server under a topic which is subscribed to by the client device to receive the notifications. In this example, I have used me and my friends' FPL mini league details.
